                <p class="text-justify">9.7 Any and all payments by or on account of the compensation payable under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any taxes. If the Subscriber is required to deduct or withhold any taxes from such payments, then the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that, after making all required deductions or withholdings, EZ Law Pay receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.</p>

THESE DISCLAIMERS APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER THOSE DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE AND WHETHER EZ LAW PAY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES. THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN SECTION 13.2. EACH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING OFFERED BY EZ LAW PAY TO SUBSCRIBER AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE FROM AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">11.3 Subscriber will solely be responsible for any damage and/or loss of Content contained in Subscriber’s technology which occurs as a result of Subscriber’s electronic equipment and/or Subscriber’s computer system.</p>
